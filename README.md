# some basic git commands to download remote branches

- `git branch` will list all of the local branches (branches available on your computer).
- `git branch -a` It will show you all of the branches available on a repo.
- `git branch <branch_name>` will create a branch based off your current branch but won't move you into that branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>` will create a branch and checkout to the branch name if available locally.
